//Bug fixes & Upgrades:

//Fixed loop condition in decisionScenario function to correctly iterate over all options.
//I removed unused variable j.
//I then added input validation to ensure the player enters a valid choice.
//I corrected the scoring logic to increase the score when the player answers correctly.
//I then updated the feedback message to display the correct choice when the player answers incorrectly.
//Next, I removed the incorrect usage of function parameters to fix the scenario with multiple correct answers.
//After, I improved the code by removing unnecessary parameters from function calls.

//Upgrades:

// Also, there was an error trying to access a file (/dev/tty) that doesn't exist.
// This error occured while using the prompt-sync library in my Node.js environment that doesn't support synchronous I/O operations in my web browser enviornment.
// To resolve this issue, I switched to an asynchronous approach for user input handling using the built-in readline module in Node.js
// This asynchronous approach helped ensure compatibility across different environments and to avoid the error I was encountering.
// This upgrade was made by creating a wrapper function that uses prompt-sync for synchronous input handling and falls back to readline for asynchronous input handling if prompt-sync is not available.

//General bug analysis of changes and upgrades to the final version of the game...

//Feedback Display Improvement:

//In the original code, feedback messages were displayed using JavaScript's 'alert' functions. 
//The 'alert' method interrupted the user experience by displaying a pop-up dialog. 
//In the final version, the feedback messages are inserted into the HTML using innerHTML.
//The final version provides a smoother user experience without interrupting the flow of the game.

//Game Progression Enhancement:

//In the original code, the game did not progress to the next scenario after handling scenarios with multiple correct answers. 
//This issue was addressed by moving the logic for advancing to the next scenario outside the condition that checks for multiple correct answers,
//This ensured that the game progresses to the next scenario regardless of the scenario type.

//End Game Message Display:

//In the original code, the end of game message was displayed using JavaScript's alert function. 
//The 'alert' method interrupted the user experience by displaying a pop-up dialog. 
//In the final version, the end of game message is dynamically inserted into the HTML using innerHTML. 
//This also provides a seamless transition and a more integrated user experience.        

//Upgrade...
//Added event listeners to the restart and exit buttons

document.getElementById('restartButton').addEventListener('click', restartGame);
document.getElementById('exitButton').addEventListener('click', exitGame);

//Upgrade...
//Added a function to restart the game
function restartGame() {
    // Reload the page to restart the game
    location.reload();
}

//Upgrade...
//Added a function to exit the game
function exitGame() {
    // Display a farewell message
    alert('Thank you for playing!');
    // Optionally, you can redirect the user to another page or perform other actions
